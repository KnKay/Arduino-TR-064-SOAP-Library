Just a bunch of info on what I did and need to do.

Background: I want to use the lib with an old Atmel base Arduino Pro Mini. 
This means I need to adopt some of the Libs to be compliant. 

Chacking the Libs there is an arduino Lib on the Platformio Market.
I will use this one and "simply" write a wrapper to be in line with the ESP one.
There are some spelling mistakes (upper ,lower) as well as some header handling which will be of interest!
